# Starter Pack

Like design systems, understanding distinction (Î”) by defining pattern (=).

## Vision

1. Initial commit message = Starting where I am using what I have doing what I can.
2. Meta moment = A starter pack for starter packs.
3. The inception of this repo is to unify and accelerate other repos.
4. Afterwards, it will house many different types of original and curated starter packs for things like apps, sites, videos, and new ideas.
